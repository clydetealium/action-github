The actions in this repo are implemented in javascript. They are built using ncc. To build an action, run the following command from the root of the repo:

```

## Conventional commit
Please see the [release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) for context.

If you keep to the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format, the release workflow will automatically bump the version of the action and create a new release on each push to main.

### Breaking
Prefix your commit message with a label and an exclamation point i.e.:
- `feat!: commit message` - a new feature that's not backwards compatible
- `feat(JIRAID-123)!: commit message` - this works as well

### Minor
- `feat:` - new feature (creates a MINOR release)

### Patch
Prefix your commit message with one of the following:
- `fix:` - bug fix
- `docs:` - documentation only changes
- `style:` - changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor:` - a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - a code change that improves performance
- `test:` - adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` - changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

## The Change Log
The [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) is automatically created and / or updated on each push to main.  Please do not edit this file manually. It also serves as the basis for retrieving release notes for the action.
